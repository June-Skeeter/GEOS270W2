# Project Proposal

Your proposal is a **Tentative** plan, you can change it after need/want.  The proposal is intended to help you approach the project with a well rounded idea and provide clarity on the expectations for the project.  Please use the proposal form here in [.pdf](Final-Project-Proposal-Form.pdf) or [.docx](Final-Project-Proposal-Form.docx).  The form includes space for: 

* A brief description of the topic
* The data sets that you will use
    * Confirmation that you are able to download them before submitting
* Preliminary analysis plans

Some things to think about when formulating your project proposal:  

* Is the project ambitious enough? Or is it overly ambitious? Would it be difficult to complete in the time remaining in the semester?
	* Your project **should not** be a repeat of one of the labs.  If you want to revisit a lab and use it as inspiration, that is fine.  But you should incorporate additional analysis and look at a different areas.
* Make sure you have a clear understanding of how you are going to go from your data to your final deliverables.
* Ensure that your data is available and easy to obtain in a usable format.

The proposal is worth 25 pts, minor comments/suggestions will be provided where applicable.  For detailed feedback, your group consider making time to meet with me either in person or over zoom during office hours (or by appointment) for further feedback.
* Proposals turned in on time, will be promptly marked and returned the same day.
* If you submit a proposal early, you can request it be marked early for quicker feedback.
* The 7-day grace period applies to proposals like it does the module assignments.  But be mindful late submissions **waive their right to prompt feedback**.
