Assessment submissions will be accepted without late penalty for seven days.  Late assignments **waive their right** to prompt grading/feedback.  Late assignments will be marked whenever is convenient for your TA (could be as late as the end of term).  After the seven day grace period, **submissions will no longer be accepted**.

#  Accommodations

My aim is to be flexible and accommodating.  I can make accommodations for you on a case by case basis, but it is your responsibility to communicate your needs in a timely fashion (i.e. email before an assignment is due)

Please contact the [Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) if you require accommodations for a disability.  If you are registered please make me aware of any necessary accommodations by email in a timely manner.

## Absences
{: .no_toc }

If you are sick (with COVID or otherwise), please stay home to protect others and take care of yourself.  Lectures will be available online and you may attend lab via zoom.

## Concessions
{: .no_toc }

If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation for your situation.  You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession, my inent is to be accomodating.  However, you must to communicate any need for a concession in a timely manner.  If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/).


# Academic Integrity:

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously.  The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment.  Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero.  A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found [here](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links)

Though you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information.
