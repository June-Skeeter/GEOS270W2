## Option 1: Geography Lab Computers

All students will be given a UBC Geography logon, you should recieve logon credentials by email before the first day of lab.
The Geography Department has two computer labs (rooms 115 and 237).  Room 115 may be accessed in-person when the geography building is open; room 239 will be closed to in person access this summer due to construction.  Both 115 and 239 can be accessed remotely (via remote desktop connection) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  To remotely access lab computers, follow [these instructions](RemoteDesktop.pdf).  Information about the Geography Computer Labs can be found [here](https://geog.ubc.ca/undergraduate/study-resources/).  **Note** the lab schedule and **refrain from remotely accessing a computer while other courses are holding lab session in that room**.

* If you have not received logon credentials, contact Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca 

* If your personal coputer is running Mac or Linux, it is **Strongly Recomened** you use this method to access ArcGIS Pro.

* There is a lab fee to use geography computers: you must [pay the lab fee](http://geog-epayment.sites.olt.ubc.ca/fees/geoglab-fees/) by May 31st or you will loose access to your account.  

* **If you are having trouble logging on remotely** try: adding "geoglab\" in front of your username.

## Option 2: Purchase a Student License

You may purchase a student version of the software to install on your own computer for $30. ArcGIS Pro requires a PC (i.e. a computer running Windows) but if you have a Mac or Linux machine you can get around this by building a Windows partition on your hard drive or using a virtual machine.

* If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you can [follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468) to setup a partition.
  * **We cannot** provide any support for this step of the installation and it will probably just be easier for you to use Option 1 instead.

**1**{: .label .label-red } Check that your computer meets the system requirements for ArcPro using [this link](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/Client/Standard/?apikey=50F41142-39B0-4061-97C2-BA7B7FE43D0E&refid=1186&item=12433).



**2**{: .label .label-red } Go [here](https://gis.ubc.ca/software/) to purchase, ArcGIS Pro.  Fill out the info, make your pamment, and you should be given and ArcOnline Account and a link to download ArcGIS Pro.
  * If you run into any issues, contact Jose Aparicio at: labhelp@geog.ubc.ca 


## Option 3: UBC Library GIS (Last Resort)

This is not a viable solution for the whole semester as computer access is limited.  However, if you are in a pinch, you can access the Koerner Library GIS Computers in person in room 217 or the computers in [room 218 remotely](https://remotelabs.ubc.ca/).  These computers are not guranteed to be running most up to date version of ArcGIS Pro.
