## Evaluation

The course is made up of six modules, a final project, and a comprehensive final exam.  The six modules will each be worth 10% of your final grade and the lowest scoring module will be dropped.  The final project and exam will both be worth 25% of your final grade.

| Points Distribution | Percent of Points |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Modules 1-6         | 50%               |
| Final Project       | 25%               |
| Final Exam          | 25%               |

## Modules

Each module is a lesson intended to introduce and cover specific topics within GIS, they will be published as individual webpages.  They will be hyperlinked in the schedule above as they are posted.  They will also be made accessible through Canvas and I will send a reminder email to the class each time a module is posted.  Each module will have consist of three sections.  

### Lecture Content
{: .no_toc}

Lecture content will consist of synchronous lectures, asynchronous video content, & course readings where applicable (there is no textbook, I'll provide .pdf files of any readings).  Lectures will be in person in GEOG 101, Tuesday/Thursday from 12:00 - 14:00.  Lectures will also be streamed [on zoom](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/68315782631?pwd=RFh0QmR1SzJ3cjhwYmlYSkZNbkcydz09) for those who cannot attend in person and recordings will be made available on canvas.
* Synchronous lectures will cover the module content in depth and serve as your chance to ask questions and engage in discussion about the material.


### Lab Applications
{: .no_toc}

The labs will build on the lecture content and give you hands on practice working with GIS software.  You can work through these in your lab section.  See the [Lab Access](/Labs.md) page for more details on specifics. 

### Assessment
{: .no_toc}

Each assessment will be due on the date listed in the [Course Schedule](#course-schedule).  The assessments will cover both lecture and lab material and will be submitted via a canvas quiz. You will be allowed multiple attempts for quizzes in case you make a mistake or would like to update your answers, only your final submission will be marked.

## Final Exam

The final exam will be completed asynchronously over Canvas. It will consist of a few essays, short answers, a flowchart question illustrating how to complete a GIS task, fill in the blanks, matching, multiple choice, and true false questions.  The exam will cumulative and count for 25% of your final mark.

* 24 Hour Window to Complete
  * 0:00 June 27th to 23:59 June 28th *(29th will an option if needed, but contact June to schedule)*
  * **One Attempt** - six hours
    * Not intended to take six hours.  I just don't want you to feel rushed.
    * If you have a letter from access and diversity and need more than the allotted time, contact me **before** the exam.

* Questions: *subject to adjustment*
  * Essays (~ 40%)
  * Flow chart question (~ 20%)
    * Create a flow chart outlining a GIS analysis
  * Short answer (~ 25%)
  * Mix of matching, fill in the blank, multiple choice, etc. (~ 15%)

## Final Project

The project is a group assignment (2-4 members) that will account for 25% of your final grade.  GIS is a collaborative discipline and your project should be done with a group unless special circumstances necessitate otherwise.  You may only work on the project alone **only** if you get approval.  I will introduce the project in depth later on in term, but if you'd like to plan ahead, you can find details on the [Final Proejct Page](docs/Final_Project.md)
