# Tips for Group Work
{: .no_toc }

Two options for facilitating group work: 

1) Use a file sharing service like Google Drive, Dropbox etc to share up to date version of the project with fellow group members.  It is a good strategy to use one of these services so you don't loose your data!!

* Make sure to remember: "Work Locally, Save Remotely!"

2) One group member can share their lab computer logon and everyone can use the same account for the project.  You'll all be able to access the same H:/ drive space.  This **won't** work well if you plan to work simultaneously.  Don't use the same account to log into two computers at the same time.  Bad things might happen.
